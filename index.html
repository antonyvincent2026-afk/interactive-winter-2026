    The weather today is quite cold. It is not as cold as last year. However, it is still pretty cold. The wind hitting your face is the worst feeling with this kind of weather. However, it is also a nice weather to enjoy a good cup of hot chocolate. Hence, I would just call it hot chocolate weather.</p>
    <p>Hot chocolate <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/hot-chocolate-weather-art-print--501025527304111303/">is a drink</a> made with milk, sugar, and cocoa powder. It is usually served hot. Some people like to add whipped cream or marshmallows on top of their hot chocolate. I personally like to add a little bit of cinnamon for extra flavor.</p>
